# my-tower-of-babel
This repo contains all my answers to the Javascript programming game/quiz of "Tower-Of-Babel".

* If you haven't done it, go and checkout http://nodeschool.io/
* If you want to start playing just install **node** and **npm**  and in your terminal type: 
```BASH
    npm install -g tower-of-babel
```

This game is mostly about EcmaScript 6 and all the new cool stuff you can do with it. I love it! Especially beacause it makes JS way easier to understand and to work with.
